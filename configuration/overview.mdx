description: Learn how nvim-luffy's core configuration is structured and organized
---

nvim-luffy provides a clean and modular configuration structure that separates different aspects of your Neovim setup into focused modules.

## Configuration structure

The core configuration is located in `lua/leyland/core/` and consists of three main modules:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Options">
    Editor settings like line numbers, indentation, and search behavior
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keymaps">
    Custom keyboard shortcuts and leader key mappings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Autocommands">
    Automatic actions triggered by events like yanking text or cursor movement
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

All core modules are loaded through `lua/leyland/core/init.lua`:

```lua
require("leyland.core.options")
require("leyland.core.keymaps")
require("leyland.core.autocommands")
```

This initialization file ensures all configurations are loaded in the correct order when Neovim starts.

## Configuration philosophy

nvim-luffy follows these principles:

<Accordion title="Minimal and focused">
  Only essential settings are included by default. The configuration avoids bloat and keeps things simple.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Modular organization">
  Each aspect of configuration lives in its own file, making it easy to understand and modify.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sensible defaults">
  Settings are chosen to provide a productive experience out of the box while remaining familiar to Vim users.
</Accordion>
