## Plugin management

All plugins are managed with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), which provides:

- Lazy loading for improved startup performance
- Automatic plugin installation
- Easy plugin updates
- Dependency management

<Tip>
Check the `lazy-lock.json` file in the root directory to see exact plugin versions and commit hashes.
</Tip>

## Customizing plugins

Plugin configurations are located in `lua/leyland/plugins/`. Each plugin has its own configuration file that you can modify:

```lua
return {
  "plugin-name",
  config = function()
    -- Your custom configuration
  end,
}
```

<Note>
Most plugins are configured with sensible defaults and keybindings that follow vim conventions.
</Note>

## Adding new plugins

To add a new plugin, create a new file in `lua/leyland/plugins/` or add it to an existing file:

```lua
return {
  "author/plugin-name",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  config = function()
    require("plugin-name").setup({
      -- Plugin options
    })
  end,
}
```

Lazy.nvim will automatically detect and install the new plugin on the next startup.
