telescope.setup({
  defaults = {

    mappings = {
      i = {
        ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous,
        ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next,
        ["<C-q>"] = actions.send_selected_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
      },
    },
  },
  pickers = {
    live_grep = {
      path_display = { "truncate" },

### Keybindings

#### Global

| Key | Mode | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `<leader>e` | Normal | Toggle file explorer |

#### nvim-tree window

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `l` | Open file/directory |
| `h` | Close directory |
| `<CR>` | Open file |
| `a` | Create new file/directory |
| `d` | Delete file/directory |

### Features

- Git status indicators
- File icons with nvim-web-devicons
- Relative line numbers for quick jumping
- Right-side positioning
- Indent markers for better visibility

<Warning>
The file explorer disables netrw. If you need netrw functionality, you'll need to modify the configuration.
</Warning>

### Tree positioning

The tree opens on the right side of the window with a width of 50 characters, keeping your main editing area on the left.

<Tip>
Use `l` and `h` in the tree for vim-style navigation: `l` to go into directories and open files, `h` to go back to parent directory.
</Tip>

## Alternative navigation tools

While not separately configured, nvim-luffy includes these optional navigation tools:

<Accordion title="fzf-lua">
Alternative to Telescope with native FZF integration. Installed as a dependency for Neogit but can be used independently for fuzzy finding.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="mini.pick">
Minimalist picker from the mini.nvim suite. Installed as a dependency for Neogit and provides a lightweight alternative to Telescope.
</Accordion>

    Use `<leader><leader>` (Telescope find_files) when you know roughly what file you're looking for.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Searching content" icon="search">
    Use `<leader>/` (Telescope live_grep) to search for text across your entire project.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File browsing" icon="folder-tree">
    Use `<leader>e` (nvim-tree) when you need to browse the directory structure or perform file operations.
