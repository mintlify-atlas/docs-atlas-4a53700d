## The leader key

All custom keybindings in nvim-luffy use the **leader key**, which is set to `Space`.

<Info>
Whenever you see `<leader>` in this guide, press the `Space` bar followed by the next key.
</Info>

## Essential workflows

### Finding and opening files

The fastest way to navigate your codebase is with Telescope:

<CodeGroup>
```vim Find files by name
<leader><leader>
" Opens Telescope file finder
" Start typing to fuzzy search
" Press Enter to open, Ctrl-v for vertical split
```

```vim Search file contents
<leader>/
" Live grep across all files
" Great for finding function definitions or text
```

```vim Recent files
<leader>fr
" Shows recently opened files
" Quick access to your working set
```

```vim Find word under cursor
<leader>fc
" Searches for the word your cursor is on
" Useful for finding all usages
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
In Telescope, use `Ctrl-j` and `Ctrl-k` to navigate results, and `Ctrl-q` to send results to the quickfix list.
</Tip>

### File navigation with Harpoon

Harpoon is your secret weapon for jumping between important files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark a file">
    ```vim
    <leader>H
    ```
    Marks the current file. Do this for your 3-5 most important files in your current task.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View marked files">
    ```vim
    <leader>h
    ```
    Opens the Harpoon quick menu showing all marked files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Jump to files instantly">
    ```vim
    <leader>1  " Jump to first marked file
    <leader>2  " Jump to second marked file
    <leader>3  " Jump to third marked file
    " ... up to <leader>9
    ```
    Lightning-fast navigation without fuzzy finding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Harpoon marks are project-specific and persist across Neovim sessions.
</Note>

### File explorer

Toggle the nvim-tree file explorer:

```vim
<leader>e
" Opens file tree on the right side
" Press again to close
```

**Inside nvim-tree:**
- `l` - Open file or expand directory
- `h` - Close directory
- `a` - Create new file
- `d` - Delete file
- `r` - Rename file
- `y` - Copy file
- `p` - Paste file

### Window management

Split windows for side-by-side editing:

```vim Window splits
<leader>|         " Split vertically
<leader>sh        " Split horizontally
```

**Navigate between splits:**
```vim
Ctrl-h    " Move to left split
Ctrl-j    " Move to split below
Ctrl-k    " Move to split above
Ctrl-l    " Move to right split
```

<Info>
These navigation keys also work with Tmux panes if you've configured Tmux integration.
</Info>

### Buffer management

```vim
<leader>bd        " Close current buffer
<leader>ba        " Close all buffers
```

## Language server features

### Code completion

In insert mode, nvim-cmp automatically shows completions:

```vim Insert mode
Ctrl-Space    " Manually trigger completion
Ctrl-j        " Next suggestion
Ctrl-k        " Previous suggestion
Tab           " Select suggestion or expand snippet
Enter         " Confirm selection
Ctrl-e        " Close completion menu
```

<Tip>
Completions include LSP suggestions, snippets, buffer words, and file paths.
</Tip>

### LSP navigation and actions

These keybindings become available when an LSP is attached:

<CodeGroup>
```vim Go to definition
gd
" Jumps to where a function/variable is defined
```

```vim Go to references
gR
" Shows all places where this symbol is used
```

```vim Go to implementation
gi
" Jumps to the implementation
```

```vim Hover documentation
K
" Shows documentation for symbol under cursor
" Press twice to jump into the floating window
```

```vim Rename symbol
<leader>rn
" Renames the symbol across your entire project
```

```vim Code actions
<leader>ca
" Shows available code actions (fixes, refactors)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Diagnostics

View and navigate errors and warnings:

```vim
[d            " Go to previous diagnostic
]d            " Go to next diagnostic
<leader>d     " Show diagnostic in floating window
```

### Formatting

Format your code with Conform:

```vim
<leader>mp
" Formats current file or selected range
" Uses Prettier, Stylua, Black, etc.
```

<Info>
Formatting happens automatically on save. Configured formatters:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript/React**: Prettier
- **Lua**: Stylua
- **Python**: isort + Black
- **HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML**: Prettier
</Info>

## Git integration

### Neogit (Git client)

```vim
<leader>gg
" Opens Neogit in floating window
```

**Inside Neogit:**
- `s` - Stage file or hunk
- `u` - Unstage file or hunk
- `c` - Commit (opens commit message editor)
- `P` - Push
- `F` - Pull
- `Z` - Stash
- `?` - Show help

### Diffview

View diffs in a beautiful side-by-side view:

```vim
<leader>dd        " Open diff view for current changes
<leader>ds        " Show diff from origin/main to HEAD
<leader>df        " Close diff view
```

## Advanced navigation

### Flash (motion)

Flash enables lightning-fast cursor movement:

```vim Normal mode
s{char}{char}
" Type 's' followed by two characters
" Labels appear - type the label to jump
```

Example: To jump to the word "function" far down in your file:
1. Press `s`
2. Type `fu` (first two characters)
3. Labels appear over all matches
4. Type the label letter to jump there

### Finding TODOs

Quickly find TODO comments across your project:

```vim
<leader>ft
" Opens Telescope with all TODO, FIXME, HACK, etc.
```

### Keymaps reference

Forgot a keybinding? Search them all:

```vim
<leader>fk
" Opens Telescope showing all keymaps
" Start typing to search
```

## Example workflow

Here's a typical workflow when working on a feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the main file">
    ```vim
    <leader><leader>
    " Type part of filename
    " Open the file
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark it with Harpoon">
    ```vim
    <leader>H
    " File is now marked as position 1
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find related files">
    ```vim
    <leader>/
    " Search for function names or imports
    " Open related files and mark them too
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Jump between marked files">
    ```vim
    <leader>1  " Main file
    <leader>2  " Test file
    <leader>3  " Utils file
    " Fast navigation without typing
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make changes with LSP help">
    ```vim
    gd            " Jump to definitions
    gr            " Check usages
    <leader>rn    " Rename if needed
    <leader>ca    " Use code actions
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your changes">
    ```vim
    <leader>dd    " View diff
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit with Neogit">
    ```vim
    <leader>gg    " Open Neogit
    " Stage changes with 's'
    " Commit with 'c'
    " Push with 'P'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
